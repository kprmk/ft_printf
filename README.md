### School 21

## Description
Regardless of the programming language considered, the printf function (or its equivalents)  
is always highly useful. The main reason is the ease of its formatting and the support of  
diverse types in variable numbers. There are variations even propose to be able to write  
the resulting string of characters either in a file descriptor or in a particular stream. 

In this project we've used **arbitrary-precision arithmetic (bignum)**  
for floating point numbers.
